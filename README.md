This repository contains the projects/mini programs I work on using PySimpleGUI, mysql-connector and other Python3 Libraries.

The repository is fully written in Python with elements of SQL queries in some programs by utilizing the mysql-connector library.

PySimpleGUI is a library that merges elements from libraries like tkinter. However, making it easier to write UI elements.
